## AngularJS - Blur Text Directive
 Created by O.Tomer
 
Using this directive, you can transform your text over html into a "dissapearing text" which at it's end is blurred.
The blur text effect puts the impression that there's more text behind it's paragraph.

### Directive usage in HTML markup

`<blur-text text="messageContent" minlength="20" elementclass="myclass" disappearingchars="14"></blur-text>`
